# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! Here you’ll find solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in multiple programming languages. This repository aims to help others learn and compare different coding approaches to common algorithmic challenges.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders by programming language and problem. Here’s a breakdown of the structure:

- **`python/`**: Solutions in Python
- **`cpp/`**: Solutions in C++


Each language folder contains subfolders named after the LeetCode problems. For example, if you have a solution for the problem "Two Sum", you might find it in:

- `python/two-sum/solution.py`
- `java/two-sum/Solution.java`
- `cpp/two-sum/solution.cpp`
- `javascript/two-sum/solution.js`
